# GPA-Calculator
I write a code of "GPA Calculator" in "Assembly Language" for my lab project.
You can calculate GPA of any semester with this program.
In the start it asks for the total number of subjects in semester and  then ask for the grades of subject and then credit hours of each subject.
It first compute GPA of the given grade of a subject and then multiply that with credit hours of the subject.
When it finds all subjects gpa then it adds the result in total.
And to find the final result it divides the total sum GPA with the total number of credit hours.
Then displays the final result.
I also write comments for each instruction so you can easily uderstand it.
